# 🧩 1️⃣ CORE SELENIUM + PYTHON QUESTIONS

## Q1. Difference between `find_element` and `find_elements`?

**Expected Answer:**

* `find_element` → returns **one WebElement**, throws `NoSuchElementException`
* `find_elements` → returns **list**, returns empty list if not found

👉 Used `find_elements` when elements may or may not exist.

---

## Q2. Why Explicit Wait is preferred over `time.sleep()`?

**Answer:**

* Explicit wait waits **only until condition is met**
* Reduces execution time
* Improves test stability
* Handles dynamic UI

```python
WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.element_to_be_clickable(locator)
)
```

---

## Q3. How do you handle dropdowns?

**Answer:**

* HTML `<select>` → `Select` class
* Custom dropdown → click + iterate elements

---

## Q4. How do you handle multiple windows?

**Answer:**

```python
parent = driver.current_window_handle
for handle in driver.window_handles:
    if handle != parent:
        driver.switch_to.window(handle)
```

---

## Q5. How do you handle file upload?

**Answer:**

```python
driver.find_element(By.ID, "upload").send_keys("C:/file.txt")
```
