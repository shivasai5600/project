Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for an Automation Test Engineer position at your organization. I have close to three years of experience working as an Automation Test Engineer, currently with Mphasis, where I support a large enterprise client, Hewlett-Packard Inc. Over this time, I have gained strong hands-on experience in building and maintaining Python-based automation frameworks for web applications.

In my current role, I work extensively with Selenium WebDriver, Pytest, and the Page Object Model to design scalable and maintainable automation solutions. I have contributed to enhancing our automation framework, developing reusable Pytest fixtures and utilities, and improving overall test stability. I am also involved in integrating automated test execution with CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, including running tests on pull requests to support continuous testing.

One of my key responsibilities has been handling flaky tests and performing root cause analysis to improve pipeline reliability. I have also worked on optimizing execution time using parallel test runs with pytest-xdist. These efforts helped improve feedback cycles and ensured better test coverage in an Agile environment.

I enjoy collaborating closely with developers, business analysts, and QA teams to understand requirements and deliver quality results. I am a quick learner, comfortable adapting to new tools and technologies, and I take ownership of the work I do.

I am now looking for an opportunity where I can further grow my skills, contribute to challenging projects, and be part of a team that values quality and continuous improvement. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience and approach to automation testing can add value to your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Punna Shiva Sai Ganesh
Automation Test Engineer
